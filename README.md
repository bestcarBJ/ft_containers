# ft_containers

In this project, you will implement the various container types of the C++ standard
template library.<br>
- Vector :  dynamic arrays that are used to store data.It is different from arrays which store sequential data and are static in nature, Vectors provide more flexibility to the program. Vectors can adjust their size automatically when an element is inserted or deleted from it.<br>
- Stack : data structure that operates based on LIFO (Last In First Out) technique. The std::stack allows elements to be added and removed from one end only.<br>
- Map : associative containers that store elements in a combination of key values and mapped values that follow a specific order. No two mapped values can have the same key values.<br>
